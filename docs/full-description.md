# Full Description

Flare Rewards Hub keeps grassroots communities engaged by turning daily wallet activity into streak-based rewards that settle instantly. Organisers struggle to manage payouts with spreadsheets, and contributors lose trust when reward values drift with market volatility. The hub solves both problems by syncing streak progress with XRPL transactions while pricing bonuses through the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) so every payout reflects fresh market consensus.

Wallet holders connect through the web dashboard and can simulate the full claim flow today. Behind the scenes, Flareâ€™s oracle feed powers dynamic multipliers while XRPL handles settlement-ready ledger entries that link straight to the public explorer. Judges will be able to watch a narrated walkthrough showing streak accrual, a claim animation, and ledger confirmations, illustrating how this combo delivers transparent rewards loops from day one.
