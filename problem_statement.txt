Build lightweight, consumer-facing applications that combine Flare’s core protocols (FAssets, FDC, or FTSO) with XRPL’s native payments, settlement, or account features. The focus is on creativity, usability, and showing how Flare + XRPL can together power engaging everyday user experiences.

Examples:
- A social rewards app where community points are distributed via XRPL payments, and their value or ranking is tied to real-time FTSO price data.
- A collectible system where badges/NFTs are minted on XRPL and evolve dynamically based on FDC-verified real-world events.
- A simple game where in-game rewards are represented as FAssets, but payouts/settlements occur through XRPL accounts.
