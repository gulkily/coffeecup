> **Judging** (donâ€™t worry - itâ€™s not scary at all! ðŸ˜„)
> 
- **WHEN** | Demo day will be on Sunday (see schedule for precise timings).
- **HOW** | Judging will be done in person on Sunday. If you entered the coding track, there are 2 phases of judging. First, youâ€™ll show your project to the judges at their judging table (this is an informal opportunity for you to show your code to them). Second, **top projects will then be selected to present formally to everyone on stage!** If you entered the no-code track, your project submission will be reviewed by the judges separately before the top ones get selected to present on stage (thereâ€™s no need to show your project to the judges at their judging table)!
- **PRESENTING (TECHNICAL TRACK)** | If youâ€™re selected to present for the technical tracks, hereâ€™s how it will go:
    - 20 seconds to connect your computer to the projector.
    - 3 mins to present.
    - 1 min for Q&A.

If you go over time, points will be deducted from your team. Your time will start as soon as the last team has stopped presenting and has left the stage.

- **PRESENTING (NON-TECHNICAL TRACK)** | If youâ€™re presenting for the non-technical track, hereâ€™s how it will go:
    - 2 mins to present (no Q&A)

If you go over time, points will be deducted from your team.

- **PRESENTING STRUCTURE** | Follow this structure when presenting:
    1. First 30 seconds for each team member to introduce yourselves (which employer/university youâ€™re from, which year, what youâ€™re majoring in etc). **Make sure you have a team slide!**
    2. Next 30 seconds to explain the problem youâ€™re solving
    3. Next 30 seconds to explain your solution and grand vision - show off how big this can get
    4. Next 30 seconds showing off your demo - show off how much you achieved!
    5. Next 30 seconds explaining how you used Flare in your project
    6. Final 30 seconds on future roadmap and what youâ€™ll do next
- **Criteria** | Submissions will be judged by Flare / XRPL Commons / EasyA representatives based on their technical merits as well as the quality of presentation.

**Submissions will be graded on a 1-10 scale in each of the following categories:**

- Innovation and Originality: The novelty of the solution and its potential to disrupt or significantly improve upon existing services.
- Usability and Design: The application's user experience and interface design, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for its intended audience.
- Impact Potential: The applicability and scalability of the solution in real-world scenarios, including its potential for adoption and the breadth of its impact on the target market or sector.
- Feasibility: The practicality of implementing the solution and the clarity of the implementation plan.
- Use of the Blockchain: Effective use of Flare and XRPL technology, demonstrating an understanding of their benefits and limitations.
- (For coding submissions) Technical Implementation: The robustness, security, and efficiency of the applicationâ€™s codebase. Proper use of smart contracts and adherence to best practices in dApp development will be crucial. You must have built your own smart contract on Flare. Simply copy/pasting from another pre-existing project will not satisfy the criteria.
